## Usage in cellular-scripts projects

The easiest way to use this configuration is with [cellular-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cellular-scripts), which includes it by default. **You donâ€™t need to install it separately.**

## Usage outside of cellular-scripts

If you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with cellular-scripts, you can install it with following steps:

First, [install Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/).

Then install babel-preset-cellular.

```sh
npm install babel-preset-react-app --save-dev
```

Then create a file named `.babelrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:

```js
{
  presets: ["cellular"]
}
```

## Options

If your project doesn't use flow, react or glamorous you can turn off these plugins to speed up the processing:

```js
{
  presets: [
    [
      "cellular",
      {
        flow: false,
        react: false,
        displayname: false,
        glamorous: false,
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

__NOTE:__ If you use this preset with [cellular-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cellular-scripts) this will be done automatically.
